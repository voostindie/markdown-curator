## About

As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marillion) states it:

> **Marillion** [/məˈrɪliən/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) are a British [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music) band, formed in [Aylesbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aylesbury), Buckinghamshire, in 1979. They emerged from the [post-punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk) music scene in Britain and existed as a bridge between the styles of [punk rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock) and classic [progressive rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock), becoming the most commercially successful [neo-progressive rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-progressive_rock) band of the 1980s.

and

> Despite unpopularity in the mainstream media and a consistently unfashionable status within the British music industry, Marillion have maintained a very loyal international fanbase, becoming widely acknowledged as playing a pioneering role in the development of [crowdfunding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding) and [fan-funded music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-funded_music). They have sold over 15 million albums worldwide.
